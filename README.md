Overview:
This project is a simple digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time using rotating hands for the hours, minutes, and seconds, styled with custom CSS and updated every second through JavaScript.

Features:
A circular clock face with rotating hands for hours, minutes, and seconds.
The hands rotate based on the current time retrieved from the system.
The clock is responsive and centered on the page with a background image for a more aesthetically pleasing display.
The JavaScript updates the time every second, ensuring the clock reflects real-time changes.
Files Included:
index.html: The HTML structure of the clock, including the layout of the clock hands and numbers.
style.css: The styling of the clock face, hands, and numbers, including a background image for the clock's display.
script.js: The JavaScript that handles the functionality of the clock, specifically the rotation of the clock hands based on the current time.
How It Works:
The clock face is created using a combination of divs for the numbers (1-12) and divs for the clock hands (hour, minute, and second).
The JavaScript retrieves the current time from the user's system, calculates the rotation degrees for each hand, and applies the rotations to update the clock every second.
The clock hands are styled to rotate in a smooth motion using CSS transform with rotate().
